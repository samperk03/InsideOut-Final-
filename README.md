# InsideOut-Final-
Final project for MCSH-C220



# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2023


## Theme
Our group interpereted the theme "Inside Out" as a maze game where you start inside, and your goal is to get out.
Some of our inspiration came from the popular flash game "The Worlds Hardest Game" 

## Game Play
Objective - The goal of the game is to escape the various mazes while collecting as many coins as possible. Be weary though, there are many obstacles and even some false exits that will reset your progress.
Game-play instructions - The instructions are very simple, use the W A S D keys to navigate the maze, collect coins by passing through them, and escape!

## Impediments
The biggest struggle we encountered was with the collaboration aspect of the project. There were several instances where our commits would not merge properly with the main version of the project. 

## Implementation
Includes 3 levels that increase in difficulty as you play. There are obstacles that impede your ability to easily navigate the maze. Coins can be collected throughout the levels.
